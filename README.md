# VivyGAN Front-End

This project **must** be used in conjunction with the [VivyGAN API](https://github.com/MayeHunt/VivyGAN_API).

This is a React web app featuring a simple UI for operating API endpoints and displaying the returned information as part of my undergraduate dissertation.

## Setup Guide
This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
To use this application:

1. `git clone https://github.com/MayeHunt/VivyGAN_Front.git` to clone this repo.
2. `cd VivyGAN_Front` to change directory to the cloned directory.
3. `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. `npm start` to host the application locally.
5. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### This application won't do anything unless the [VivyGAN API](https://github.com/MayeHunt/VivyGAN_API) is also hosted locally on port 8000.
